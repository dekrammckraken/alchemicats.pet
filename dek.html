                    <strong>"A bit of history about these two wonderful and sweet creatures
                        that live with us."</strong>
                    <br />
                    These two cats are sisters and come from the countryside of a small
                    Italian province. We adopted them when they were just a few months
                    old and dedicated ourselves to ensuring their growth in a healthy
                    and harmonious environment.
                    <br />
                    Today we can proudly say they've been
                    pampered and spoiled, but in the end, who could resist two adorable
                    faces like theirs? Despite being raised the same way, they've
                    naturally developed two diametrically opposite personalities. And we
                    can't help but mention how incredibly sweet they are, bringing joy
                    and affection into every moment of our lives. Their names, by the
                    way, reflect our passion for video games (no need to mention them).

                        Also known as Cirilla and Zireael, the fashionista glides
                        effortlessly from one point to another. Her psychic abilities are so
                        strong that she can make you turn around without even saying a word,
                        leaving you with a feeling of disorientation and prompting you to
                        ask, "Hey Ciri?" Her response will be a simple "Mh Mh," leaving you
                        both unsettled and amazed at her power. Her existence can be
                        described by only a few people, as she doesn't enjoy visits from
                        humans who aren't part of the family, but for everyone else, there's
                        social media.

                        A sweet yet complex European black cat, this little feline possesses
                        extraordinary skills in human communication. Her facial expressions
                        alone convey a range of emotions, and if that's not enough, her
                        vocalizations will undoubtedly support her visual intentions.
                        Without a shadow of a doubt, she makes it clear that her desires
                        must be fulfilled, leaving no room for negotiation. Unlike her
                        sister, the sociability of this cat is something unparalleled,
                        beginning with a show of ballet moves and spins, almost always
                        ending with an injury to the spectator.
