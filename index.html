        These two cats are sisters and come from the countryside of a small
        Italian province. We adopted them when they were just a few months old
        and dedicated ourselves to ensuring their growth in a healthy and
        harmonious environment.
        <br />
        Today we can proudly say they've been pampered and spoiled, but in the
        end, who could resist two adorable faces like theirs? Despite being
        raised the same way, they've naturally developed two diametrically
        opposite personalities. And we can't help but mention how incredibly
        sweet they are, bringing joy and affection into every moment of our
        lives. Their names, by the way, reflect our passion for video games
        (no need to mention them).

      <h3>Alchepicats, Alemicats... Alchemicats, why this name?</h3>
      <p>
        I chose to call them 'Alchemicats' because I see them as two different
        chemical elements, each uniquely special, with diverse personalities
        and shades. Just a small change or a different situation can create an
        explosion of colors and fascinating behaviors. Our cats are like
        magical ingredients that, when mixed together, create a unique blend
        of fun, affection, and surprises, filling our lives with a rainbow of
        emotions every day.
      </p>
      <h3>...and that logo, what the heck is it?</h3>
      <p>
        If you've ever wondered what on earth the Alchemicats logo represents
        and how in the fantastical world it's connected to our cats, well,
        here's the wacky explanation: The logo depicts half of each of the
        cats, fused in a Yin and Yang style with the most vibrant colors you
        can imagine. The shapes are a bizarre mishmash of a bat, a dragon, and
        a ghost. This union symbolizes equality, while the colors are like our
        rainbow of feline personalities. The representations of the dragon and
        the bat are associations that emerged as the cats grew over time. Oh,
        and not to forget, the ghost... it represents us humans. Yep, let's be
        honest, cats totally own us!

        <h3 class="ciri">Ciri</h3>
        <p>
          Also known as Cirilla and Zireael, the fashionista glides
          effortlessly from one point to another. Her psychic abilities are so
          strong that she can make you turn around without even saying a word,
          leaving you with a feeling of disorientation and prompting you to
          ask, "Hey Ciri?" Her response will be a simple "Mh Mh," leaving you
          both unsettled and amazed at her power. Her existence can be
          described by only a few people, as she doesn't enjoy visits from
          humans who aren't part of the family, but for everyone else, there's
          social media.

          A sweet yet complex European black cat, this little feline possesses
          extraordinary skills in human communication. Her facial expressions
          alone convey a range of emotions, and if that's not enough, her
          vocalizations will undoubtedly support her visual intentions.
          Without a shadow of a doubt, she makes it clear that her desires
          must be fulfilled, leaving no room for negotiation. Unlike her
          sister, the sociability of this cat is something unparalleled,
          beginning with a show of ballet moves and spins, almost always
          ending with an injury to the spectator.
