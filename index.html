          These two cats are sisters and come from the countryside
          of a small Italian province. We adopted them when they
          were just a few months old and dedicated ourselves to
          ensuring their growth in a healthy and harmonious
          environment.
          <br />
          Today we can proudly say they've been pampered and
          spoiled, but in the end, who could resist two adorable
          faces like theirs? Despite being raised the same way,
          they've naturally developed two diametrically opposite
          personalities. And we can't help but mention how
          incredibly sweet they are, bringing joy and affection
          into every moment of our lives. Their names, by the way,
          reflect our passion for video games (no need to mention
          them).
        </p>

        <h3>
          Alchepicats, Alemicats... Alchemicats, why this name?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We chose to call them 'Alchemicats' because I see them as
          two different chemical elements, each uniquely special,
          with diverse personalities and shades. Just a small
          change or a different situation can create an explosion
          of colors and fascinating behaviors. Our cats are like
          magical ingredients that, when mixed together, create a
          unique blend of fun, affection, and surprises, filling
          our lives with a rainbow of emotions every day.
        </p>
        <h3>...and that logo, what the heck is it?</h3>
        <p>
          If you've ever wondered what on earth the Alchemicats
          logo represents and how in the fantastical world it's
          connected to our cats, well, here's the wacky
          explanation: The logo depicts half of each of the cats,
          fused in a Yin and Yang style with the most vibrant
          colors you can imagine. The shapes are a bizarre
          mishmash of a bat, a dragon, and a ghost. This union
          symbolizes equality, while the colors are like our
          rainbow of feline personalities. The representations of
          the dragon and the bat are associations that emerged as
          the cats grew over time. Oh, and not to forget, the
          ghost... it represents us humans. Yep, let's be honest,
          cats totally own us!

        <h3>
          I Rolled the Dice and Today Went Like This
        </h3>
        <p>
          Every day, after a long day of work and my usual routines — like feeding the two furballs who probably spent
          the whole day napping — it’s finally time to relax. “The whole day napping, and finally time to relax”: anyone
          with cats knows how impossible that is! I turn on my computer, log into Steam, and get ready… No, I’m not a
          fisherman! While my system updates and checks everything, I prepare to dive into a game
          Zelda, as usual, needs a minute to get going after her meal; Ciri, on the other hand, is always ready and
          excited for the next adventure. After I play with Ciri, Zelda, my “diesel engine,” eventually warms up and
          joins the fun for a few minutes, making her presence known in only the way a cat her size can. They switch in
          and out — Ciri, then Zelda, and so on — for a good thirty minutes, depending on the day and their moods.
          Suddenly, as if they’ve both made a secret decision, I become irrelevant; they lose interest, walk off, and
          leave me feeling like a fisherman with an empty bucket.
          I close my windows, check for updates, and get ready for the second round. This might happen at different
          times each day, but always seems to start right in the middle of my game. The trick is not to launch a game
          that needs my full focus right away.
          Then, the announcement: game over, time to chill. Like a spell from an ice wizard, my hands are “frozen,”
          unable to move for at least 15 turns; inspiration is low at this hour, after all. Once the turns are up, it’s
          dice-roll time, and the results might change with the season. These days, it means they hover behind my chair,
          making me balance on about ten percent of my seat, with a few gentle kicks.
          From here, it’s stealth mode: any sudden move could wake up the two bosses of the house. And yes, even the
          “sleepy” one is always on alert. In stealth mode, I can relax for a while, as long as I stay quiet, until Ciri
          comes over for her nightly “petting ritual” — without which, the day simply can’t end.
          This daily routine reminds me that as much as we love to plan, life enjoys mixing things up. These days, a
          good routine is a flexible one; sticking to “this always worked before!” is a luxury we can’t afford. Every
          day is a new roll of the dice, so let’s keep practicing and try again.

        <h3>
          Uncattable: One Journey
        </h3>
        <p>
          When we decided to adopt two cats, we thought of getting one male and one female. We believed this would
          increase the chances of them getting along — a typically human thought, but not an unusual one. We also wanted
          both of them to be black, thinking that having a single color would be easier to “manage.”
          We chose two cats because we believed they would live better as a pair, keeping each other company. And being
          of different sexes, everything would go smoothly, right? After all, what could go wrong? Divorce? Alimony?
          Well, we’re already paying for their food! It’s just in our heads.
          On paper, everything seems great, and in reality, it is — but not because of our plan. Having two wildcats —
          or in our case, a tiger and a panther — running around the house is extraordinary. Watching them, trying to
          understand what they’re thinking as they play, run, and adapt to daily life is fascinating. But the most
          incredible part is discovering that they, too, have a routine: they follow you, they know what you’re about to
          do, and sometimes even anticipate it, making you realize when you’re running late. This shows that coexistence
          is possible and enjoyable.
          However, we also have to consider the effort our felines make to adapt to an environment that isn’t quite
          suited to their nature. In many cases, even today, people don’t fully understand the best way to provide them
          with a habitat that meets their needs. Is it really that hard to understand the needs of a species different
          from ours? All it takes is a bit more attention; everything is in their gestures, their glances, their habits,
          and their daily routines.
          At some point, the differences fade away. We’re all living beings, sharing the same roof by social convention.
          In fact, even we, at many times, would have preferred things to be different from the reality we live in. Just
          like them, we adapt. Over time, we learn to live with our limitations and find our place, just like our cats,
          who, despite having different needs from ours, adapt to their new routine and life with us.
          Having two cats doesn’t change much compared to having one. We can have a thousand theories about how we think
          things will go from a human perspective, but in the end, it’s nature that determines how events will unfold,
          regardless of what we believe. One thing is certain, at least for those of us who love them deeply: dividing
          love between two cats is anything but easy. Understanding how to split attention between them, taking into
          account their needs and desires, is complex. It’s difficult to split one “love” in two.
          Uncattable? No, thanks!

        <h3>
          Shaving Christmas
        </h3>
        <p>
          I’ve been navigating through this mess for days now. But honestly, is this even solvable? Articles and videos
          keep promising to tackle one of the most insane dilemmas ever thought up: “how to put up a Christmas tree with
          cats in the house.” I mean, I can’t be the only one dealing with this, right?

          I’ve got two options, and guess what? I lost the lottery. Zelda would chew the tree to pieces, and Ciri would
          pull it down; all I’m missing is Satan instead of the star, and the chaotic masterpiece is complete. But does
          it really have to be this complicated? It’s a tradition, after all, and people love traditions — especially
          around this time of year, when everyone’s supposed to be kinder and full of values. Colorful lights, holiday
          cheer… it’s full-blown capitalism, people everywhere buying stuff. Hmm, I think I get it now: maybe they’re
          not real people.

          I’ll figure this out. I mean, there are a ton of smart people out there who have to have an answer for this,
          right? Let’s see: plastic tree? Lame! Hanging the tree from the ceiling? Are you serious? Have you ever met a
          cat? A tree hanging from the ceiling? Yeah, sure. And the ornaments? Oh, that’ll go better, right? Not a
          chance! There’s tinsel everywhere, and they’ll chew it up. And if the ornaments are small, who even knows what
          they’re made of. Ugh! A real tree, then? That’s just nuts! Not even Mother Nature can help me out here.

          I think I’ve overestimated humanity, or maybe this really is impossible. Oh, look, another video: “My cat
          ignores the tree and decorations; they’re so well-behaved.” Please, what kind of cats do you have? Because
          mine are nothing like that — and they’re not even that hyper! Ugh, I give up. I’ll just scatter a few
          decorations around the house and maybe throw in some little Christmas figurines. It’s not much, but at least
          it’ll look like Christmas.

          I’ll try again next year — hopefully by then, someone who likes both cats and Christmas will have a solution.
          For now, the main thing is that we all survive the holidays.

        <h3>
          All Fireworks Come to Harm
        </h3>
        <p>
          The final days of a year are approaching, a year that for many has been extraordinary, for others disastrous,
          and for those who appreciate the nuances, full of ups and downs. The past three years have taught me not to
          particularly value this much-anticipated date, December 31st, which many consider an opportunity to leave
          behind difficult days and cross the boundary of a purely symbolic milestone into another equally symbolic new
          beginning.

          A rather indifferent day. However, the idea that someone could truly believe that with a simple passage of
          time, they enter automatically into a better world, without having done anything concrete to change it, seems
          to me, to use a euphemism, “innocent.”

          This indifference, recently, has transformed into a warmth, so intense that it highlights not only the naivety
          of those who hope for a better world without effort but also the injustice of this hope, which ends up being
          cultivated at the expense of those who have truly earned that improvement by fighting and waiting patiently
          for their sacrifices to bear concrete fruit in the new year.

          We are not all the same, and not everyone wants to live the life of others. It is right for each person to
          understand their life for what it is. But it is not right to alter the path of another’s life.

          At a certain point within us, a mechanism is set in motion that reveals reality for what it is, not as we had
          imagined it until that moment. For many, this is a shock that the unconscious rejects; some suffer it
          passively, others take note of it, acting and doing something… for some, it is already too late.

          One of the greatest powers that comes from taking care of someone is responsibility, a word that, in my
          opinion, is widely abused to describe situations that do not reflect the actual weight that word can carry.
          But, on the other hand, we are used to abusing all words, using them to create that “wow” effect that attracts
          attention because we are no longer able to argue our thoughts. Thus, we use these verbal tricks to get
          noticed, preferring the effect to the content.

          These gestures reflect on actions, which, in fact, are no more dangerous than words, but create more tangible
          effects and break down those walls that words cannot overcome.

          New Year’s fireworks not only kill and terrify, but they also hurt their handlers, who watch their “loved
          ones” suffer for a futile amusement, a moment that has nothing to do with the idea of ensuring a better year,
          not only for people but for all living beings. In the end, the new year belongs to everyone. Why not make sure
          it’s better for everyone, without harming anyone?

        <h3>
          The Complexity of Interpolation
        </h3>
        <p>
          Between humans and cats, there lies a great mystery. How often do we think we know exactly what our friends
          will do, and how often do they change our minds? In the end, the only thing that matters is what lies in
          between. Black and white are the result of what the shades of gray represent, and we’re talking about just two
          colors.

          Cats are not shades of gray; they come in a wide array of colors. Understanding them can seem impossible, but
          all we can do is try to figure out how to interact with them.

          What we understand is what they want us to understand because, not fully grasping what they want, they too
          must somehow adapt. The simplest way is to try different routines or get them accustomed to them until we
          notice they are actually accepted. Although it remains a mystery, it is still something. In fact, it may seem
          difficult to follow and require commitment, but when compared to the complexity of the human race, it is truly
          a small thing. Therefore, taking the time to pay attention and observe our friend(s) is essential:
          understanding even just a glance out of place, when we expect a purr, may require your attention. Does it
          sound paranoid? Perhaps, but in fact, if you transpose all of this into your daily life, it’s exactly what
          happens every day in the outside world. Taking care of loved ones involves worry, concern, laughter, play, and
          joy; these are all essential emotions. Just as, fortunately, beautiful things happen that stay with us,
          unfortunately, sad things happen that leave their mark. It’s part of the game of life.

          We are all shades of something more evident than ourselves: we are the interpolation of facts, events, or
          people, and we cannot change it.

          Why should the affection we have for our dear friends be any different? Terms like “animals” are often used in
          a disparaging way, as if “they” cannot experience the same “amazing” sensations that we, humans, experience.
          Everything shouldn’t always be simplified and reduced to just a simple relationship of superiority. If we are
          as intelligent as we assume, we should prove it in such obvious things.

          A sweet yet complex European black cat, this little
          feline possesses extraordinary skills in human
          communication. Her facial expressions alone convey a
          range of emotions, and if that's not enough, her
          vocalizations will undoubtedly support her visual
          intentions. Without a shadow of a doubt, she makes it
          clear that her desires must be fulfilled, leaving no
          room for negotiation. Unlike her sister, the sociability
          of this cat is something unparalleled, beginning with a
          show of ballet moves and spins, almost always ending
          with an injury to the spectator.
